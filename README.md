##System Overview
#Project Abstract
This document proposes a video game to add to the “Exer-games” genre by implementing a game that is
controlled fully by dumbbells. Using Dumbbells the player will be able to fight monsters and beat levels
all while the scores are kept and can be compared on a live leaderboard. Each level will be unique in the
way that the exercises, reps, and sets will be different leading to the overall development of the player's
muscles. To play, the player would place the attachment to the dumbbell, the sensor on the attachment
records every rep the player performs, and each rep would trigger an attack.
#Conceptual Design
The video game itself will be coded using Unity and C# and there should not be any other languages
needed on the coding end, since there are built in databases to store the users local data. Hardware side we
will use an Arduino with the needed DoF sensors in order to get the movements of the player.
#Background & References
Exercise games are getting more popular in today's world with one of the original games being the Wii Fit
board, which helped build balance and cardio through an electronic personal trainer. For a more modern
example, Ring Fit Adventure uses a circle in which you can squeeze and run with in order to attack
monsters. There are more realistic games that utilize bikes to have you race around iconic locations
against other players in the game.
